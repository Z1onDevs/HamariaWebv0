## 📋 Selling Strategy

### **Step 1: Lead with Base**
Start every conversation with base membership benefits
- "Everything unlimited for €22,000/year"

### **Step 2: Identify Needs**
Ask about specific goals:
- Looking younger? → Aesthetics
- Stressed/executive? → Stress Management
- Weight goals? → Detox & Weight
- Chronic pain? → Pain Program
- Maximum longevity? → Advanced Longevity

### **Step 3: Show Program Value**
Break down program pricing:
- "€10,000/year = €833/month for 90+ specialized sessions"
- "That's only €111 per session if purchased à la carte"

### **Step 4: Offer Combinations**
- "Many members combine 2-3 programs for comprehensive care"
- "Base + Longevity + Stress = €42,000/year, you get 500+ sessions"
