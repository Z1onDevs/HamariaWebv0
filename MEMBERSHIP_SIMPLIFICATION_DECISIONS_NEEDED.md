# Membership Simplification - Decisions Needed

**Date:** November 20, 2025  
**Status:** 🚨 **AWAITING KEY DECISIONS**  
**Priority:** 🔴 **CRITICAL - REQUIRED BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION**

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

Before we can implement the single-tier membership structure, we need your decisions on several critical questions. This document outlines each decision point with recommendations.

---

## 💰 1. PRICING DECISION

### **Question**: What price for the single "Hamaria Members" tier?

#### **Context**:
- Current top tier (Aesthetics+): €1,650/month
- Current mid tier (Longevity/Performance+): €1,450/month  
- Current base tier (Wellness): €950/month
- New membership includes MORE than any current tier

#### **Options**:

| Option | Monthly | Yearly | Rationale | Risk Level |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|------------|
| **A: Premium** | €2,200 | €24,200 | Reflects all-inclusive value, positions as ultra-luxury | 🔴 High - May lose price-sensitive members |
| **B: Premium-Mid** | €1,850 | €20,350 | Slightly above old top tier, signals upgrade | 🟡 Medium - Balanced approach |
| **C: Top Tier Match** | €1,650 | €18,150 | Matches old Aesthetics+ price | 🟢 Low - Easy to justify to current members |
| **D: Mid-Tier Plus** | €1,450 | €15,950 | Matches old Performance+ price | 🟢 Low - Significant value increase |

#### **Recommendation**: 
**Option B (€1,850/month)** - Positions above previous top tier, shows this is something new and comprehensive, while remaining competitive.

#### **Yearly Discount**:
- **10% off**: €20,350/year (save ~€1,850)
- **15% off**: €18,870/year (save ~€3,330)
- **Founders Bonus**: 3 months free = effectively 25% off first year

#### **Your Decision**:
```
Monthly Price: € _________
Yearly Price:  € _________
Yearly Discount: _____%
```

## 🎁 2. COMPLIMENTARY PROGRAMS STRATEGY

### **Question**: How should complimentary (add-on) programs be structured?

#### **Option A: À La Carte Only**
- Members buy individual sessions as needed
- Simple pricing: €X per session
- **Pros**: Flexible, easy to understand
- **Cons**: May feel "nickel and dimed"

#### **Option B: Program Packages**
- Sell packages: "Aesthetics 5-Pack" at discount
- Example: 5 HydraFacials for €600 (save €150)
- **Pros**: Encourages commitment, higher average order
- **Cons**: More complex to manage

#### **Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)**
- À la carte available for all
- Discounted packages for frequent users
- Monthly subscriptions for popular services
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility, multiple revenue streams
- **Cons**: Requires more setup

#### **Example Pricing**:

| Service | À La Carte | 5-Pack | 10-Pack | Monthly Sub |
|---------|------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| HydraFacial® | €150 | €650 (13% off) | €1,200 (20% off) | - |
| Therapeutic Massage | €90 | €400 (11% off) | €750 (17% off) | €300/month (4x) |
| EMS Training | €80 | €350 (12% off) | €650 (19% off) | €280/month (4x) |
| Cryolipolysis | €350 | €1,500 (14% off) | - | - |

#### **Your Decision**:
```
Pricing Structure: [ ] À La Carte  [ ] Packages  [ ] Hybrid

Launch with packages: [ ] Yes  [ ] No, add later
```

## 👥 3. EXISTING MEMBERS MIGRATION

### **Question**: What happens to current members on old tiers?

#### **Scenario 1: Immediate Migration (Recommended)**
- All members move to new "Hamaria Members" tier
- Adjust billing based on legacy tier:
  - **Wellness** members: Pay €X (upgrade)
  - **Longevity** members: Pay €Y (upgrade)
  - **Aesthetics** members: Pay €Z (minor adjustment or same)
- Give 30-day notice before price change
- **Timeline**: Implement within 60 days

#### **Scenario 2: Grandfather Old Tiers**
- Existing members keep current tier forever (or until they choose to upgrade)
- New members only get new tier
- Maintain two parallel systems
- **Timeline**: Indefinite

#### **Scenario 3: Transition Period**
- Give existing members choice to:
  - Stay on current tier for X months (e.g., 6 months)
  - Upgrade now with incentive (e.g., 10% off first year)
- After transition period, auto-migrate
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months

#### **Recommendations by Current Tier**:

| Current Tier | Current Price | New Price | Increase | Recommendation |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Wellness** | €950 | €1,850 | +€900 (95%) | Offer 6-month transition at €1,200, then full price |
| **Longevity** | €1,450 | €1,850 | +€400 (28%) | Offer 3-month transition at current price, then upgrade |
| **Aesthetics** | €1,650 | €1,850 | +€200 (12%) | Direct upgrade with 1-month notice |

#### **Your Decision**:
```
Migration Strategy: [ ] Immediate  [ ] Grandfather  [ ] Transition
