## 💬 FAQ

### **Q: Why simplify to one tier?**
**A**: Research shows fewer choices = higher conversion. Plus, operationally simpler and stronger brand.

### **Q: What if someone only wants basic wellness?**
**A**: They get incredible value with unlimited access to core facilities. Compare to à la carte pricing (€1,400-2,000/month) - the membership is a bargain.

### **Q: How do we compete with cheaper gyms?**
**A**: We're not a gym - we're a comprehensive longevity center. Comparing to regular gyms is like comparing a luxury spa resort to a basic hotel.

### **Q: What about people who can't afford €1,850/month?**
**A**: 
- Offer payment plans
- Corporate partnerships
- Founders pricing (locked-in rate)
- Focus on value proposition

Luxury brands don't need to serve everyone—just the right customers.

### **Q: Will we lose existing members?**
**A**: Some churn is possible during transition. However:
- Most members will see value increase
- Transition periods soften the impact
- Those who leave weren't target customers
- Revenue per retained member increases significantly

Net result: Likely revenue positive even with 10-15% churn.

### **Q: How long until we see results?**
**A**: 
- **Immediate**: Simpler operations, clearer marketing
- **30 days**: First new members under new structure
- **90 days**: Revenue impact measurable
- **6 months**: Full benefits realized
